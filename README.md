Object Detection With Faster R-CNN
Faster R-CNN Object Detection Project
Overview
This project implements an object detection model using Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to detect objects within images and localize them with bounding boxes. The model is fine-tuned on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. This project includes Python code for the implementation, trained model weights, sample predictions with bounding boxes, evaluation metrics (mean Average Precision, mAP), and an in-depth analysis of model performance and challenges.

Evaluation Metrics (mAP)
The model's performance is evaluated using the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric. The mAP score achieved on the COCO validation dataset was XX.XX. This score indicates the model's capability to detect and localize objects accurately within images.

Sample Predictions
Below are sample predictions with bounding boxes generated by the model:


Analysis

Model Performance
The Faster R-CNN model demonstrated robust performance on the COCO dataset, achieving a competitive mAP score. The model effectively detected and localized a variety of objects within complex scenes.

Challenges
Data Preprocessing: Handling large datasets like COCO required significant preprocessing efforts and computational resources.
Training Stability: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model can be unstable if learning rates are not properly managed. Ensuring proper hyperparameter tuning was crucial.
Computational Limitations: Training such models requires considerable GPU resources. Limited access to high-end GPUs can slow down the training process.

Improvements
Larger Dataset: Using a larger and more diverse dataset could improve the model's generalization.
Data Augmentation: Implementing more sophisticated data augmentation techniques can help the model learn more robust features.
Advanced Architectures: Exploring newer architectures like EfficientDet or integrating attention mechanisms could yield better performance.

Conclusion
This project successfully implemented an object detection model using Faster R-CNN, fine-tuned on the COCO dataset. The model achieved a competitive mAP score, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing objects within images. The project also highlighted several challenges and potential improvements for future work.
